This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn/npm run dev`

Runs the client app and the server in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view client it in the browser.
The server can be reached at [http://localhost:5000](http//localhost:5000).

Both the server and client are run with Nodemon and will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `yarn/npm run  start`

Runs the server in the development mode.<br/>
The server can be reached at [http://localhost:5000](http//localhost:5000).

The server is not run at nodemon env, and it will need to be restarted at any changes.

### `npm/yarn build`

Builds the client app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
